# What is this?
This is a .NET framework Exe parser that parses and executes the IL code in the executable. This library does not depend on any Windows libraries or .NET Self reflection. This library can also read most of the metadata and PE Headers in the .NET executable.
Feel free to contribute.

# TODO
Properly parse metadata tokens in ldstr
Implement lots of IL Instructions

# Building
Set the DotNetParser or TesterKernel project as the startup project in visual studio and click on Run.
