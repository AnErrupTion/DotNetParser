# What is this?
This is a .NET framework EXE parser that parses the IL code and reads .NET Metadata in the executable. This library does not depend on any Windows libraries or .NET Self reflection.
Feel free to contribute.

# Will this execute my .NET Project?
No, not yet. It's currently WIP.

# Building
Set the DotNetParser or TesterKernel project as the startup project in visual studio and click on Run.
